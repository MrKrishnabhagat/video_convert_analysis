Features:
 ✅ Automated Testing: Run automated tests against Video-Converter.com using Playwright
 ✅ AI-Powered Analysis: Use Groq API to analyze test results and generate troubleshooting suggestions
 ✅ Dynamic Script Generation: Generate test scripts dynamically based on specific test parameters
 ✅ Comprehensive Reporting: View test results, screenshots, and AI analysis in a user-friendly interface
 ✅ Test History: Track all test runs with detailed metrics and outcomes
