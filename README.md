Agentic AI Backend for Automated File Conversion Testing

This project is an AI-powered backend application that automates the testing of a file conversion website (Video-Converter.com). It enables users to run predefined tests, view test results, and generate detailed reports on the performance, accuracy, and reliability of the file conversion service.

Features:
 âœ… Automated Testing: Run automated tests against Video-Converter.com using Playwright
 âœ… AI-Powered Analysis: Use Groq API to analyze test results and generate troubleshooting suggestions
 âœ… Dynamic Script Generation: Generate test scripts dynamically based on specific test parameters
 âœ… Comprehensive Reporting: View test results, screenshots, and AI analysis in a user-friendly interface
 âœ… Test History: Track all test runs with detailed metrics and outcomes
